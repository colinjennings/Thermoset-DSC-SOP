    "### The Crucible Weighing Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC and TGA uses an extremely precise balance to mesure the mass of the sample as it changes over the course of an experiment. The analysis software calculates heat flow into the sample with respect to mass (displayed as mW/g), which is very useful when comparing samples of different masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample robot and and carousel on the TGA/DSC 3+ allow you to queue up to 34 samples and run them sequentially. It also allows you to automatically weigh your crucibles on the extremely accurate balance before you put your samples in. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one small problem -- the lid. If the lid has not yet been sealed to the top of crucible, the robot cannot pick the lid and the crucible up for weigh in. This is unfortunate, as it means we cannot know how much the lid and crucible weigh together, and thus we cannot weight the sample when it goes into the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current lab procedure is as such: place a lid and a crucible on a benchtop scale and tare it. Weigh out the phenolic sample, then input this into the software. I find this insuffcient for two reasons:\n",
    "1) You lose precision by using a less-sensitive balance.\n",
    "2) Since the samples lose mass as their volatiles evaporate while sitting on the carousel, the input mass may be inaccurate by the time the sample is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "My procedure has been as such: Weigh the crucibles using the sample robot weigh-in. Mass each lid on a bench top balance, then prepare your sample. Run the experiment. Then, with a bit of math, you can adjust the heat flow curve to cancel out the extra mass from the lid."

    "I wanted to calculate the average mass and standard deviation of some empty crucibles and lids. I loaded 10 empty crucibles into the machine and got their masses. I then added lids, sealed them, and took their masses. To see if there was drift in the instrument, I waited 24 hours and measured the exact same cruibles again.

    "The standard lids for the 100 uL aluminum pans are soft enough to be be easily bent inward (into the concave) to a 90 degree angle. I place a bent lid into each each empty crucible, then run the automatic weigh in with the sample robot. I get more consistent results when I check click the check box to make the furnace hold temperature at 25ºC for 30 seconds and let the balance equilibrate. While this is happening, I am loading liquid phenolic into the crucibles that have already been run. For the sake of trying to get roughly the same amount of sample into each crucible, I put them on a bench top scale and try to drip about 20 mg of liquid phenolic into them with a pipette. I make sure the liquid is spread out over the bottom and not clinging to one side. I will tap the crucible a few times to hopefully pop any larger bubbles. Then, I take my bent lid, roughly flatten it out, poke my hole, then seal it in the press as usual. The result is a completely normal-looking, sealed crucible.\n",
